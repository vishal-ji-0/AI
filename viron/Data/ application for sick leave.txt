Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and after consulting with my doctor, it has been determined that I need to take some time off to recover.

I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am back. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work.

In the meantime, if there is anything that needs to be done urgently, please let me know and I will do my best to assist from home.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
